    "My entire life I have struggled to remember the good times and the little things that made me smile.  I would get so angry or frustrated or annoyed or overwhelmed with life that my only memories became these negative events and feelings\n\n"

    "I spent a great deal of time in therapy where I explored these feelings and my perceptions.  I learned of the [b][u]glad[/u][/b] acronym and was challenged to begin documenting every day for a week the things for which I was [b][u]grateful[/u][/b], what I had [b][u]learned[/u][/b] that day, what I [b][u]appreciated[/u][/b], and something that [b][u]delighted[/u][/b] me.  This simple two- or three-minute practice before bed quickly changed my overall energy.\n\n"

    "The one-week challenge quickly turned into a month-long challenge and then it became a daily habit.  I would enter the information into my notes app on my phone and then hand write it in a journal the next day.  I wanted to create a tool that would remind me to record my positive experiences, something that was searchable for a name or a topic, and something with quick access to a “feelings wheel”.  I find that when I can identify my feelings, the power that they have over me diminishes.\n\n"

    "I believe that we all struggle with mental health issues whether they are severe and impact our daily lives or not.  If you or someone you love is suffering, please find help.\n\n"

    "Find the joy.  Remember the positive. Be grateful.  Learn something new every day.  Appreciate the little or the big things in life. And always find something that delights your soul.\n\n"
